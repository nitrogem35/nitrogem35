ðŸ“œI'm nitrogem35, though my (online) friends usually call me nitro :)

I specialize in ðŸ§ªreverse engineering and ðŸ“Šreal-time data visualization, as well as a bit of ðŸ•¹[game development](https://discord.gg/usNUSZAXGc).

Languages I've used and their applications:
- JavaScript: game dev [node.js/vanilla], stats scrapers for takepoint and gats.io [discord.js], data vis [chart.js], interactive UI for frontend apps [reactjs]
- Python: APIs with Flask, pentesting
- AutoHotKey: automation of data extraction from some spreadsheets and custom keybinds
- Java: simple algorithms such as base10 -> base2 conversion
- SQL: storing records for users of games I've developed (Gunnarz)
- WebAssembly: reverse engineering web apps

ðŸŒ€ I play Codewars sometimes, you can friend me on there if you'd like: **https://codewars.com/users/nitrogem35**
