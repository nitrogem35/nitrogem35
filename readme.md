Hi, I'm nitrogem35, though my friends usually call me nitro :)

I specialize in reverse engineering and real-time data visualization, as well as a bit of [game development](https://discord.gg/usNUSZAXGc).
Languages I've used:
- JavaScript (game dev [node.js/vanilla], statistics scrapers for takepoint and gats.io [discord.js], data vis [chart.js], interactive UI for frontend apps [reactjs])
- Python (APIs with Flask, pentesting)
- AutoHotKey (automation of data extraction from spreadsheets and custom keybinds for games)
- Java (basic algorithms such as base10 -> base2 conversion)
- Bash (scheduled execution of nodejs scripts)
- SQL (storing account data for users of games I've developed)
- Rust (currently learning in order to build blazingly fast applications)

I play Codewars sometimes, you can friend me on there if you'd like: **https://codewars.com/users/nitrogem35**
