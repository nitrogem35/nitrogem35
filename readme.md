ðŸ“œI'm nitrogem35, though my (online) friends usually call me nitro :)

I specialize in ðŸ§ªreverse engineering and ðŸ“Šreal-time data visualization, as well as a bit of ðŸ•¹game development.

Some of the languages and tools I've used and their applications:
- JavaScript: game dev [node.js server/vanillajs client], stats scrapers for takepoint and gats.io [discord.js], data vis [chart.js, Grafana], interactive UI for frontend apps [React]
- Python: APIs with Flask, pentesting
- AutoHotKey: automation of data extraction from some spreadsheets and custom keybinds
- Java: simple algorithms such as base10 -> base2 conversion
- SQL: storing records for user accounts

ðŸŒ€ I play Codewars sometimes, you can friend me on there if you'd like: **https://codewars.com/users/nitrogem35**
