# whoami
HiðŸ‘‹ I go by nitrogem35 online, but people often use "nitro" for short :)

I have experience in a few niche areas such as reverse engineering javascript and web game development.

# hobbies
ðŸŒ€ I play [Codewars](https://codewars.com/users/nitrogem35) sometimes, you can friend me on there if you'd like.

ðŸŽ® I also play [TETR.IO](https://ch.tetr.io/u/f_35) and am currently U rank at ~the 98th percentile.

Another thing I enjoy is writing. I might eventually make a substack or start a blog on my [website](https://nitrogem35.pw/).

# notice
My commit graph is a bit janky starting around 2/25 because of an integration I built that uploads players' TETR.IO replays here. The stats card above should show the actual data if you're curious.
