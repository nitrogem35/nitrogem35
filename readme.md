# whoami
Hi👋 I go by nitrogem35 online. I'm currently studying CS at Texas A&M University.

My biggest project so far is takepoints.io, an open-source remake of a game I played as a child. I don't keep the servers online anymore, but it is fairly easy to self-host.

# hobbies
I like competitive programming (though I'm not very good at it yet). I used to play [Codewars](https://codewars.com/users/nitrogem35), however these days I am more active on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/t-spin-triple).

Another thing I enjoy is writing. I might eventually make a substack or start a blog on my [website](https://nitrogem35.pw/).
